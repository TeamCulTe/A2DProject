TODO :
Review BookDBManager's methods -> Better performances.
Review API / Read methods in order to get only the needed fields.
Use last update field in order to update sqlite database values from distant database.
See if excluding the last update fetching in every manager classes (QUERY_ALL).

Update steps :
    1 - DBManager queries the list of id/update from MySQL db.
    2 - Do the same for the SQLite db.
    3 - Browse both lists in order to get the id of the entities to update.
    4 - Updating the one that exists (id in both lists).
    5 - Creating the id that doesn't exists in SQLite.
